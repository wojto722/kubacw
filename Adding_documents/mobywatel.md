mObywatel
===

mObywatel uses current identity data from state registers. These are names, surnames, dates of birth, PESEL number, photo, expiration date, ID number, information on who issued the document.

The data stored on the smartphone is encrypted and signed with a certificate. The certificate also confirms the authenticity of the data. You get it when you activate the application - it is assigned only to you and only to your phone.

Even if your phone is lost your data is safe - it is protected not only by encrypted data but also by phone lock and password, which you choose when activating the application.

**Please note:**   

You **cannot** use mObywatel in a situation where the law requires you to show your ID card or passport (in a bank, at the airport, at a notary's, registering a SIM card, for example).  

You **cannot** use mObywatel if your ID card is not valid - it has been blocked due to theft or loss, for example.
