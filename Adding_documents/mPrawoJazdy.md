mPrawo Jazdy
===

The mPrawo Jazdy is a digital document with a representation of your driving privileges.

mDriving license uses up-to-date data from state registers. More precisely, from the data contained in the Central Register of Drivers (part of the Central Register of Vehicles and Drivers). 

You can use this document:

- when renting or car
- confirming your driving privileges
- buying car insurance
- during a roadside check (although usually, the police check your information online)
- during a collision - when you show your driving privileges to another driver without calling the police. 

The data stored on the smartphone is encrypted and signed with a certificate. The certificate also confirms the authenticity of the data. You get it when you activate the application - it is assigned only to you and only to your phone.
